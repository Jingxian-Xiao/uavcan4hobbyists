## Fimwares ##

Files with a "-4bl" or "-wobl" in their name require the bootloader to be installed. Install procedure:

* Flash the bootloader using e.g. a ST-Link and the SWD pins or a USB-TLL adapter and the system bootloader. Also do a full erase.

* Upgrade the firmware via UAVCAN, e.g. by using the UAVCAN GUI Tool.

## Downloading ##

For downloading a single file from a github repo, this appears to be the correct sequence of steps (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4604663/download-single-files-from-github):

1. Click the file you want to download to view its content.
2. Click the Raw button.
3. Right-click the mouse and choose Save as.
